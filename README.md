Module 5 Challenge for Laura Jordan

## Description
In this exercise, I analyzed data on 249 mice who were identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. These mice were given a range of drug regimens and over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the different drug regimens.
